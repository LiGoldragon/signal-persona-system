# ARCHITECTURE — signal-persona-system

The Signal contract between `persona-system` (producer of
OS facts) and `persona-router` (consumer of focus observations). The whole
channel is one `signal_channel!` invocation in `src/lib.rs`.
It relates one router subscription client to the system observer:
the router names observation targets and the system mints
observation generations.

## Channel

| Side | Component |
|---|---|
| Sender (event side) | `persona-system` |
| Receiver (request side) | `persona-router` |

The router initiates subscriptions via `SystemRequest`;
`persona-system` accepts and pushes `SystemEvent` events as
focus state changes. The channel is
**bidirectional** but the steady-state flow is system →
router (push events).

Per `~/primary/skills/push-not-pull.md`, this channel IS
the push substrate. The router never polls; it subscribes
once per target then waits for events.

## Record source

This contract defines its records locally
(`SystemTarget`, `NiriWindowId`, `FocusObservation`,
`ObservationGeneration`, etc.) because they're the
channel's vocabulary, not records that travel beyond.

If a future channel needs `SystemTarget` (e.g. a harness-discovery channel),
make or update the relation-specific `signal-persona-*` contract for that
relation. Do not lift system observation payloads into `signal-persona`; that
crate is the top-level engine-manager contract.

## Messages

```
SystemRequest                    SystemEvent
├─ FocusSubscription             ├─ FocusObservation
├─ FocusUnsubscription           ├─ WindowClosed
├─ FocusSnapshot                 ├─ SubscriptionAccepted
└─ SystemStatusQuery             ├─ ObservationTargetMissing
                                 ├─ SystemStatus
                                 └─ SystemRequestUnimplemented
```

Closed enums; no `Unknown` variant on the wire (the
target-missing event is an explicit typed fact, not a wire-level
"forward-compatible new variant").

Prompt cleanliness, typed write leases, and programmatic write-injection
acknowledgements are terminal transport records. They live in
`signal-persona-terminal` and are enforced by `persona-terminal` /
`terminal-cell`, not by this system observation contract.

`SystemStatusQuery` and `SystemStatus` are the daemon-skeleton
readiness surface for the component itself. A valid request whose
runtime behavior is not built yet returns
`SystemRequestUnimplemented`; it is a typed event, not a text error
or a hang.

## Versioning

`signal_core::Frame` carries the protocol version.
Schema-level changes (adding a new subscription kind or
event variant) are breaking; coordinate `persona-system` +
`persona-router` upgrades.

## Examples

```text
;; router → system: subscribe to focus events for Niri window 223
SystemRequest::FocusSubscription(FocusSubscription {
    target: SystemTarget::niri_window(223),
})

;; system → router: subscription accepted
SystemEvent::SubscriptionAccepted(SubscriptionAccepted {
    target: SystemTarget::niri_window(223),
    kind: SubscriptionKind::Focus,
})

;; system → router: focus changed (this Pi window now focused by user)
SystemEvent::FocusObservation(FocusObservation {
    target: SystemTarget::niri_window(223),
    focused: true,
    generation: ObservationGeneration::new(12),
})

```

## Round trips

Round-trip tests in `tests/round_trip.rs` cover all request variants, all
event variants, `SubscriptionKind`, and representative `From` impl witnesses.
NOTA text witnesses cover every request and event variant. `SystemTarget` has a
manual NOTA codec so the text form preserves the target head, for example
`(NiriWindow 223)`.

The `ObservationGeneration` field on focus observations is the monotonic
counter the system mints; the router uses
it to discard stale events when subscriptions race.

Architectural-truth tests fire when:
- A new variant is added without a round-trip test.
- The Frame's encode/decode bytes don't match.
- A consumer tries to dispatch on a variant that isn't in
  the closed enum.

## Non-ownership

- No Niri adapter — that's `persona-system`.
- No focus-tracker actor — that's `persona-system`.
- No terminal prompt gate logic — that's `persona-terminal` / `terminal-cell`.
- No transport (UDS path, reconnect, timeouts).
- No subscription accounting — that's `persona-system`'s
  actor.
- No runtime implementation of status handling — the contract owns
  only the typed records.
